## Account Verification (KYC) on OKX

OKX doesn't require you to verify all three levels. However, user withdrawal limits on the exchange are calculated according to account verification level. Specifically:

- Withdrawal limit for unverified KYC users: 0 BTC/day. This means if you don't verify your account, you won't be able to withdraw funds from the exchange.
- Withdrawal limit for Level 1 KYC users: 0.5 BTC/day.
- Withdrawal limit for Level 2 and 3 KYC users: 100 BTC/day.
- This limit may increase depending on your trading volume. If you have multiple sub-accounts, note that only one of them can be KYC verified.
- If you don't need to withdraw 100 BTC/day, you only need Level 1 verification â€“ Basic verification. However, we recommend taking a bit more time to complete Level 2 KYC verification to ensure account security. This also increases your withdrawal limit for when you have high trading needs.
